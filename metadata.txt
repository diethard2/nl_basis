description=Extends processing framework to create and fill spatialite databases from zipped XML-files holding Basis Registration Geodata of the Netherlands.
about=Processes big zipped XML-files with free geodata that can not be imported directly in QGIS, it needs to be processed first. This version contains only 1 algorithm to process BAG (buildings and addresses). Works currently only on Windows OS. More algorithms will be provided soon to import other Basis Registration Geodata and do some post-processing as well.
